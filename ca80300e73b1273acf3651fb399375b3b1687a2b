      "message": "Keep this sub component clean and decoupled from vuex store. Just move it to the parent component wich is already connected to the vuex store and pass the call capability as prop.\n\nFrom my perspective it would even make sense to pass all capabilities as a single prop. It could be helpful later. And would take less effort, if we want to add something like \"send fax\", \"send sms\" or \"send message\" in the future.",

      "message": "Thanks for the feedback, appreciate it.\n\nRe decoupling, I\u0027ve now moved the getter to the parent and passed down as prop.\n\nRe passing all capabilities as single prop, I agree, but chose not to spend time on this now as it seems like a bigger effort due to context and multiple states together needed to form complete capabilities state, adstate.capabilities not enough on it\u0027s own. For example isCallAvailable is relying on state.initialized and both fax and sms features have an extra state.features manually set state to keep in mind.",
